    <h2><mark>(Auto)Biography:</mark></h2>

    <p>
        
        <B>(Auto)Biographies are tricky.</B>  Everything in life is tricky.  I think I started being more aware of that while I was in the army.  That whole experience seemed to be a lesson in learning that nothing ever goes as planned, and nothing is ever really exactly like you <mark>imagine</mark> it will be.  
        <br>
        <mark>My focus, at the moment, is mostly focused on</mark> sustaining and improving my relationships and athletic skills; and making money is tied <i>heavily</i> into both of those equations<sup>1</sup>. It's kind of like a balancing act between those three things (relationships, sports, money), and then that balance is <ins>hugely</ins> effected by other <mark>variables like sleep and diet and meditation and a bunch of other things<sub>2</sub>.</mark>  
        <br>
        The most important <mark>relationships</mark> in my life are with my fiance, my dog, and my immediate family.  My favorite<mark>sports</mark>  to play are ping pong and rock climbing.  And for <mark>money</mark>, I work at a store called Play It Again Sports, and use the benefits provided for me by the VA.
